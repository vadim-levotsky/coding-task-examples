### 1. FizzBuzz

```
Given a number 'n', for each integer 1 to n (inclusive) print one value per line as follows:
  - if 'i' is a multiple of both 3 and 5 => FizzBuzz
  - if 'i' is a multiple of 3 (but not 5) => Fizz
  - if 'i' is a multiple of 5 (but not 3) => Buzz
  - if not multiple 3 or 5 => print i value.

Constrains: 0 < n < 2*10^5
```

### 3. Find all leader in an array
```
Write a program to collect all the leaders in the array. 
An element is a Leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side.
Note: The rightmost element is always a leader.

Input: inputArr[] = { 16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2 }
Output: outputArr[] = { 17, 5, 2 }
```
